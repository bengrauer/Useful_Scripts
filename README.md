# useful_scripts
This project is where I place useful scripts for quick access and display.  At this time, this will only contain scripts that I have created myself.

Current there is a python and sql subcategory.
1) Python - contains a python script to load a csv and perform some basic counts
2) sql - contains an Impala script to generically profile data
